## Credits & Links

[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) is the foundation for everything.
[Oh my Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh) is the project I use for theming and (most) plugins.
[Fastfetch Configs](https://github.com/LierB/fastfetch) is the project I use to get my fastfetch configs. 

Please show some love to these projects! This wouldn't be possible without them.

## Prerequisites

```bash
zsh
